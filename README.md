# Dummy-sudo-for-doas
This is a dummy arch package that with satisfy base-devel's sudo dependency allowing me to uninstall sudo and also create a symlink so sudo will use doas.

Simply open a terminal and install the PKGBUILD file.

TODO:
Have it automatically generate a config for doas and set the config files correct permissions.
